# React firebase chat app

A chat application that currently allows you to sign in with google
and chat in chatrooms that users will soon be able to create.
The app will be a simple tool that allows you to communicate with 
other people. It also uses react-firebase-hooks to recieve messages live
and not require page reload to get updates.
